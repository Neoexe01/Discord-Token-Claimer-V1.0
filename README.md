# Discord-Token-Claimer-V1.0

In account.txt text document you will enter discord accounts as email:password
↑-1 account for each row-↑

the bot enters the accounts and takes their tokens and saves them in tokens.txt 

get own token takes the accounts you have entered in the discord application and saves them in Own Tokens.txt text
↑-it doesn't matter if the account is protected, it gets it from the files-↑

show tokens.txt viser tokens som er lagret i tokens-mappen

NOTE: If some accounts do not receive tokens, you need to enter that account 1 time, other token claimers have been tested
and approved

captcha api is not used to pass discord's captcha system If the bot cannot pass the captcha,
it will give you a link and you will manually pass the captcha from that link, then you will paste the link it gives
there and the process will continue.

can tokenize multiple accounts (process may take some time)

INFO: A system has been added to enter accounts like 2FA and get their tokens, but it does not work as desired
the system is as follows email:password:backup codes for the account

Discord:php-neo for questions

if this program is very popular I will share the source code

GOOD USES :D
