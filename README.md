# Discord token Claimer V1.0

In account.txt text document you will enter discord accounts as email:password
↑-1 account for each row-↑

the bot enters the accounts and takes their tokens and saves them in tokens.txt 

get own token takes the accounts you have entered in the discord application and saves them in Own Tokens.txt text
↑-It doesn't matter if the account is protected or not, it gets it from the app's files-↑

Show tokens.txt shows saved account tokens

NOTE: If some accounts do not receive tokens, you need to enter that account 1 time, other token claimers have been tested
and approved

VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION
----------------------------
Here are the reasons why virustotal shows viruses when scanned:
1-Decryption: CryptUnprotectData and AES decryption can be detected as malware behavior.
2- Directory Access and File Reading: The process of reading and extracting the contents of files in specific directories is commonly used by malware, which causes it to be detected as a virus.
3-Token Collection: Collecting user login credentials can be detected as malicious.
4-HTTP Requests: HTTP requests made using the requests module can be interpreted as data exfiltration.


captcha api is not used to pass discord's captcha system If the bot cannot pass the captcha,
it will give you a link and you will manually pass the captcha from that link, then you will paste the link it gives
there and the process will continue.

INFO: A system has been added to enter accounts like 2FA and get their tokens, but it does not work as desired
the system is as follows email:password:backup codes for the account
